# AGENTS.md — web-eclipse-aasx-explorer

Tool-agnostic instructions for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Copilot, Windsurf). Claude Code reads these via `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md` (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md));
other tools read this file directly.

## Project
**A modern, web-based platform for managing, validating, and exploring Industry 4.0 digital twins**
Stack: TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Rules every agent must follow
1. **Respect existing boundaries.** Treat unfamiliar, load-bearing code as frozen until the module map says otherwise.
2. **No layout churn.** Don't reorganize directories; existing contributors depend on
   the structure.
3. **Test before done.** Run the suite matching your change; never declare success
   untested. Build: `npm install && npm run build` · Test: `npm test`
4. **Match the license-header practice of neighboring files** — copy their header if
   they have one, add none if they don't.
5. **Locate, then read.** Use `ai/guide/MODULE_MAP.md` to find code; grep before
   reading whole files.
6. **Surgical diffs.** Change only what the task needs.
7. **Provenance.** Anything you write into `ai/` is `[inferred]` until a human flips
   it to `[verified]`. Never flip that tag yourself.
8. **No Phantom Bugs & Configuration Churn.** Do not rewrite, restructure, or simplify configuration or instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `package.json`, or `ai/guide/` documents) based on quick searches or automated suggestions. Keep edits surgical. Never replace detailed guides with simplified stubs. (one exception: during /cold-start only, the pass may correct the stamped Build/Test lines in this file and AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and the Definition-of-done line in ai/guide/CONVENTIONS.md, after verifying against real config files — tag each correction `[inferred]` and change nothing else in these files)
9. **Verify claims.** Before declaring a task finished, run `node install.mjs verify . --strict` (or equivalent test runner validation script) to ensure no file paths in the knowledge documents are broken.
10. **Record work.** Every unit of work ends with an appended row in `ai/lab/WORKLOG.md` linking its spec, review, and commits — even work done outside the command workflows.

## Knowledge map
**Navigation (fast path):** `ai/guide/MODULE_MAP.md` (where code lives),
`ai/guide/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system shape), `ai/guide/FEATURE_MAP.md` (feature → files
+ gotchas), `ai/guide/CONVENTIONS.md` (how to write code here).

**Generated analysis (on demand):** `ai/analysis/` — feature catalog, audit reports,
diagrams. **Development intelligence:** `ai/lab/` — specs, ADRs, evaluations.

**Machine-readable facts:** `ai/repo-profile.json` (produced deterministically by the
kit's `orient` step — trust it for stack facts, verify before relying on commands).

## Repo intelligence (the `ai/` knowledge-base)
The `ai/` folder is the single source of truth for repository intelligence. It is
tool-agnostic: any AI coding agent (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex) reads the same
verified maps, architecture docs, and feature catalogs. New features, refactors, and
onboarding all start here. A tool's private per-machine memory (e.g. Claude Code
auto-memory) is not shared — record durable knowledge in the committed `ai/` layer so
every agent and teammate sees it.

If backup files (e.g. `CLAUDE_bkp_*.md` / `AGENTS_bkp_*.md`) exist, they are the prior
configuration. Knowledge was extracted from them during /cold-start — use `ai/guide/`
as the authoritative source instead.
