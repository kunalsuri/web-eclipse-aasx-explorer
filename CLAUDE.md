# web-eclipse-aasx-explorer — Claude Code project memory

# Imports tool-agnostic rules (Claude Code native directive)
@AGENTS.md
# Relative link for non-Claude agents: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)

**A modern, web-based platform for managing, validating, and exploring Industry 4.0 digital twins**
Stack: TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Build & test — VERIFY in the cold-start pass before trusting
- Build: `npm install && npm run build`
- Test:  `npm test`
- Test locations: tests/
- Run the suite matching what you changed BEFORE claiming success.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)
- **Respect existing boundaries.** Treat unfamiliar, load-bearing code as frozen until the module map says otherwise.
- Check `ai/guide/MODULE_MAP.md` Stability before editing any file. `frozen` = hands off.
- Anything you write into `ai/` is `[inferred]` until a human flips it to `[verified]`.
  Never flip that tag yourself.
- **No Phantom Bugs & Configuration Churn:** Do not rewrite, restructure, or simplify configuration or instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `package.json`, or anything in `ai/guide/`) based on quick searches or automated suggestions. Keep edits surgical. Never replace detailed guides with simplified stubs. (one exception: during /cold-start only, the pass may correct the stamped Build/Test lines in this file and AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and the Definition-of-done line in ai/guide/CONVENTIONS.md, after verifying against real config files — tag each correction `[inferred]` and change nothing else in these files)
- **Verify claims:** Before declaring a task finished, run `node install.mjs verify . --strict` (or your repo's verify script) to ensure no file paths in the knowledge documents are broken.
- **Record work:** Every unit of work (feature, bugfix, refactor, process change) ends with a row appended to `ai/lab/WORKLOG.md` — even work done outside the slash commands.

## Where to look — read on demand, do NOT pre-load
- Role → path manifest:   ai/INDEX.md
- Machine-readable facts: ai/repo-profile.json   (orient output; deterministic)
- Find code by area:      ai/guide/MODULE_MAP.md   <- START HERE to locate anything
- What & why:             ai/guide/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- System shape:           ai/guide/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Feature -> files:       ai/guide/FEATURE_MAP.md
- Conventions:            ai/guide/CONVENTIONS.md
- Generated analysis:     ai/analysis/   (feature catalog, diagrams, audit reports)
- Specs / ADRs / evals:   ai/lab/

## Token discipline
- Locate via MODULE_MAP.md, then open only needed files. Don't crawl the tree.
- Prefer grep and line counts over whole-file reads.
- Delegate isolated/heavy work to subagents: `repo-explorer` (read-only exploration),
  `feature-builder` (implements), `test-runner` (tests).

## Repo intelligence (the `ai/` knowledge-base)
The `ai/` folder is the single source of truth for repository intelligence. It is
tool-agnostic: any AI coding agent (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex) reads the same
verified maps, architecture docs, and feature catalogs. New features, refactors, and
onboarding all start here. Claude Code's auto-memory is machine-local and unshared —
the committed `ai/` layer is the source of truth every agent and teammate reads, so
record durable knowledge there.

If `CLAUDE_bkp_*.md` exists, it is the prior configuration. Knowledge was extracted
from it during /cold-start — do not re-read it; use `ai/guide/` instead.

## Cold start
If `ai/guide/MODULE_MAP.md` still has placeholder rows, run `/cold-start` once, then a
human audits (set Stability, flip [inferred] -> [verified]) before features are built.
If backup files (e.g. `CLAUDE_bkp_*.md`) exist, the agent will extract and reuse
knowledge from your prior configuration to seed the ai/guide/ documents.
