# ai/lab/ — development intelligence for web-eclipse-aasx-explorer

The strategic layer: *how* we build and *what we learned* — not code, not navigation.
Loaded when planning or reviewing, not on every agent session.

| Folder | Contains | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/` | One spec per planned/in-progress feature or bug fix | Human + AI draft |
| `decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | Human |
| `reviews/` | Evidence-based change reviews, one per unit of work | AI (fresh session) + human |
| `evaluations/` | Post-implementation retrospectives | Human |
| `experiments/` | AI-agent approach trials: prompts, configs, outcomes | Human + AI |
| `WORKLOG.md` | The work ledger — one row per unit of work, linking all of the above | AI appends, human audits |
| `ROADMAP.md` | The feature roadmap — Planned backlog + Shipped index, per feature (cousin of `WORKLOG.md`) | AI drafts, human audits |

## The engineering loop — every unit of work (feature or bug)
```
1. Spec      →  specs/SPEC_<name>.md            (feature — copy SPEC_TEMPLATE.md)
                specs/BUGFIX_<name>.md          (bug — copy BUGFIX_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Decide    →  decisions/ADR_<n>-<title>.md    (any non-obvious design choice)
3. Implement →  /add-feature or /fix-bug — the agent reads the spec
4. Review    →  reviews/REVIEW_<id>.md via /review-change (fresh context,
                never the implementing session)
5. Evaluate  →  evaluations/EVAL_<name>.md      (human, after the work ships —
                copy EVALUATION_TEMPLATE.md)
6. Record    →  WORKLOG.md row linking spec ↔ review ↔ eval ↔ commits
7. Learn     →  experiments/EXP_<n>-<desc>.md   (optional — if the AI approach
                was novel or failed)
8. Archive   →  (optional) mark spec implemented; entry lands in
                ai/analysis/FEATURE_CATALOG.md
```
Steps 1–6 are the canonical loop — Spec → Decide → Implement → Review →
Evaluate → Record; steps 7–8 are optional follow-ups. No code before step 1,
no merge before step 4, no closed row before step 6.
`verify` checks every backticked path in WORKLOG.md, so the ledger cannot
silently rot.
