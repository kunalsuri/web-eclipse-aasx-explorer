# ai/guide/ — agent navigation for web-eclipse-aasx-explorer

Concise, always-loaded navigation docs. These point to code; they don't duplicate it.

Reading order for a new agent session — and the fastest onboarding path for a new
human teammate once these docs are `[verified]`:
1. `MODULE_MAP.md` — where everything lives, and what is safe to touch (Stability).
2. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — what this project is and why.
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the big pieces and how they connect.
4. `FEATURE_MAP.md` — feature → files, intent, gotchas.
5. `CONVENTIONS.md` — how to write code that fits.

House rules:
- Keep every file here short. Long generated artifacts belong in `ai/analysis/`.
- Every claim is `[inferred]` until a human flips it to `[verified]` with a date.
