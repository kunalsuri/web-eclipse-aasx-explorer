# Module map — directory → responsibility → entry point

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a scaffolded template.** Run the `/cold-start` slash command in Claude Code (or see [docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex](../../docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex) for other tools) to have the agent explore your repository and automatically populate this file.

> **Index only.** Find the area here, then open the entry file directly. Don't crawl

> Last verified: <fill in date> @ commit <fill in sha>

## Stability legend (the most important column)
- `frozen` — inherited / load-bearing legacy, **or generated/vendored code**: never
  hand-edit; if it has a regeneration command, name it in the Responsibility cell
  and change the module only by re-running it. **DO NOT edit** without explicit
  instruction.
- `stable` — works; change carefully and with tests.
- `ours`   — active development surface. Safe for agents to modify.
- `?`      — not yet audited. **Treat as `frozen` until a human decides.**

## Modules (run `/cold-start` to populate, then audit)
| Directory | Responsibility (one line) | Entry point | Stability (guess) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <fill in> | <fill in> | <fill in> | ? | [inferred] |
<!-- verify-ignore:start -->
<!-- Example (illustrative, not a claim about this repo): | `src/api/` | HTTP routes | `src/api/main.ts` | ours | [inferred] | — the human audit rewrites Status to [verified] (YYYY-MM-DD) -->
<!-- verify-ignore:end -->

Detected test locations (from orient): tests/

## Audit protocol
1. /cold-start fills rows, Stability = its guess (or `?`), Status = `[inferred]`.
2. A human sets Stability per row and flips confirmed rows to `[verified] (date)`.
3. Agents treat `?` rows as `frozen`. Agents never flip tags.
