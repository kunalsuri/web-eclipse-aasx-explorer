# Architecture — web-eclipse-aasx-explorer

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a scaffolded template.** Run the `/cold-start` slash command in Claude Code (or see [docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex](../../docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex) for other tools) to have the agent explore your repository and automatically populate this file.

> Status: skeleton from the kit (2026-07-14). The /cold-start pass fills it; a human
> audits it. Tag every claim `[inferred]` or `[verified] (date)`.

## The big pieces  `[inferred]`
<3–7 bullets max: the major runtime components and one line each. Names must match
real directories from MODULE_MAP.md.>

## How they connect  `[inferred]`
<The main seams: frontend↔backend protocol, service↔database, events, queues. State
the PROTOCOL only if verified in code; otherwise write "UNSURE — needs human".>

## Diagrams
Text-based (Mermaid) diagrams live in `ai/analysis/diagrams/`. Regenerate them via
/cold-start; do not hand-maintain.

## Invariants an agent must not break  `[verified] required`
<Only humans add rows here. Examples: "generated code in X is never hand-edited",
"public API schemas are backwards compatible".>
