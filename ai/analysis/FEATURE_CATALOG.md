# Feature Catalog — web-eclipse-aasx-explorer Master Index

---

> ## Provenance & scope
>
> **Status until generated: PLACEHOLDER.** This catalog is populated on demand by
> `/create-feature-catalog`, not by `/cold-start`. The example rows below use
> `<angle-bracket>` placeholders on purpose — they are illustrative only, and the
> deterministic `verify` command ignores them, so a freshly installed repo stays
> mechanically honest until you generate real, backtick-quoted entries.
>
> **Cold-start snapshot — 2026-07-14** (commit `<commit-hash>`), once generated.
>
> **Confidence key used throughout (same scheme as `ai/INDEX.md`):**
> - `[inferred]` — written by an agent or tool; a guess until a human checks it
> - `[verified]` — a human confirmed it, with the date. Agents never set this tag.
> - `?` in Status column — requires a human decision/audit
>
> **What this file does NOT contain:** planned but unimplemented features ➔ see `ai/lab/specs/`

## How to use the catalog (Split provision for complex codebases)

Depending on the complexity of web-eclipse-aasx-explorer, the catalog can live in a single file or be split to reduce token context overhead:

### Option A: Single-file Catalog
For small to medium codebases, keep all feature indices, API surfaces, and touch lists in this file.

### Option B: Split Catalog (only if there is a real split to make)
The split below assumes a backend + frontend project. **Many projects are not** — a
CLI, a library, a single-language service, a data pipeline. If that is you, keep
everything in this file and leave the split files empty (or delete them). Use this
master file as the navigation layer when you do split:

| File | Contains | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| **This file** (`FEATURE_CATALOG.md`) | Feature index, API surface summary, cross-stack touch lists, decision tree | Always — it is the navigation layer |
| [`FEATURE_CATALOG_BACKEND.md`](FEATURE_CATALOG_BACKEND.md) | Detailed backend modules, classes, and architectural roles | Working on backend/services |
| [`FEATURE_CATALOG_FRONTEND.md`](FEATURE_CATALOG_FRONTEND.md) | Detailed frontend components, hooks, routes, and styles | Working on frontend/UI |

## §1 Feature Index

> The two rows below are **placeholder examples** — `/create-feature-catalog` replaces
> them with real features (in backticks). If you still see angle brackets, the catalog
> has not been generated.

| ID | Feature | What it does | Entry point(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **Example Feature** | Brief description of capability | `<src/example_service.ext>` `[inferred]` | `?` |
| F2 | **Another Feature** | Brief description of capability | `<src/another_module.ext>` `[inferred]` | `?` |

## §2 API / Interface Surface (if applicable)

Detail the public surface this project exposes — REST/GraphQL endpoints, CLI commands,
exported library functions, or message handlers. Skip if not applicable.

| Operation / Entry | Handler | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<operation-name>` | `<handler-symbol>` | Description of purpose |

---

## §3 Full-Stack Touch Lists

For each feature, list the exact files to touch across layers (omit layers you don't have).

### F1 — Example Feature
| What to change | File / Component | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core logic | `<src/example_service.ext>` | `[inferred]` |
| Entry / interface | `<src/example_entry.ext>` | `[inferred]` |

---

## §4 Where New Code Lives — decision tree

```
What kind of change?
├── New core logic?    ➔ target the relevant module under your source root
├── New interface?     ➔ target the API / CLI / UI layer that exposes it
└── New data/schema?   ➔ target the schema or model layer
```

> Replace the generic targets above with the real directories from your `MODULE_MAP.md`.

---

## §5 Specification-Driven Development — new features

New features follow a spec-first workflow:

```
1. Create specification: ai/lab/specs/SPEC_<feature-name>.md
2. AI fills in: Full-stack design based on this catalog
3. Human approves spec
4. AI implements using the /add-feature skill
5. AI updates: FEATURE_CATALOG.md
```
